# go-rados - Go bindings for RADOS distributed object store and block devices

## Installation

    go get github.com/noahdesu/go-rados

The native RADOS library and development headers are expected to be installed.

## Documentation

Detailed documentation is available at

### Connecting to a cluster

Connect to a Ceph cluster using a configuration file located in the default
search paths.

```go
conn, _ := rados.NewConn()
conn.ReadDefaultConfigFile()
conn.Connect()
```

A connection can be shutdown by calling the `Shutdown` method on the
connection object (e.g. `conn.Shutdown()`). There are also other methods for
configuring the connection. Specific configuration options can be set:

```go
conn.SetConfigOption("log_file", "/dev/null")
```

and command line options can also be used using the `ParseCmdLineArgs` method.

```go
args := []string{ "--mon-host", "1.1.1.1" }
err := conn.ParseCmdLineArgs(args)
```

For other configuration options see the full documentation.

### Pool maintenance

The list of pools in a cluster can be retreived using the `ListPools` method
on the connection object. On a new cluster the following code snippet:

```go
pools, _ := conn.ListPools()
fmt.Println(pools)
```

will produce the output `[data metadata rbd]`, along with any other pools that
might exist in your cluster. Pools can also be created and destroyed. The
following creates a new, empty pool with default settings.

```go
conn.MakePool("new_pool")
```

Deleting a pool is also easy. Call `DeletePool(name string)` on a connection object to
delete a pool with the given name. The following will delete the pool named
`new_pool` and remove all of the pool's data.

```go
conn.DeletePool("new_pool")
```

### RADOS block devices

```go
rbd, _ := rbd.List(pool)
fmt.Println("RBDs", pools)

order, _ := rbd.Create(pool, "kiki", 512)
fmt.Println("Order", order)

ret, err := rbd.Open(pool, "kiki", true, "zizi")
fmt.Println("Open ?", ret, err)

rbd.Rename(pool, "kiki", "koko")
rbd.Remove(pool, "koko")
```
